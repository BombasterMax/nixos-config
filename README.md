# My NixOS Config

NixOS configuration based on GNOME, flakes, Home Manager and NixVim.

## Features

- Basic configuration based on [nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/)
- GNOME and a GNOME-like Firefox profile, barbarously stolen from [@poli0iq](https://github.com/poli0iq)
- NixVim, again borrowed from [@poli0iq](https://github.com/poli0iq)
- Command-line environment based on Fish + Starship (adapted from my previous configs)
- Zed editor configuration, borrowed and adapted from a post on Reddit
- A set of basic packages for development, cybersecurity and miserable life
## TODO

- Add support for more languages and features to Zed
- ???
